# Rock Paper Scissors Game 🎮

A simple interactive **Rock Paper Scissors** game built using **JavaScript**. This was developed as part of my practice with core programming concepts such as functions, control flow, user input, loops, and basic DOM interaction via the browser console.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)** – for all the game logic
- **Browser Prompt/Console** – to interact with the user
- **VS Code** – development environment
- **HTML (optional placeholder)** – if integrated into a future UI version

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Function creation and modular coding
- Handling **user input** via `prompt()`
- Using **Math.random** to simulate computer decisions
- Managing **program state** with variables (score tracking)
- Using **loops** (`for`) to repeat rounds of the game
- Implementing **conditional logic** with nested `if/else` blocks
- Understanding **scope** (global vs local variables)

## 🕹️ How It Works
- The game plays **5 rounds**.
- Each round, the player is prompted to enter `"Rock"`, `"Paper"`, or `"Scissors"`.
- The computer generates a random choice.
- The winner of each round is logged in the console, and scores are updated.
- After 5 rounds, the final winner is declared based on scores.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add a user-friendly **web interface** (buttons instead of prompt)
- Keep score visually in the UI
- Add **animations** and **sound effects**
- Expand to include best-of-N or unlimited rounds
